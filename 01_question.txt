Question - An array is given, do you have to loop the array to display the original property of the array? (The array has some additional properties.)
Topic - Array

Solution- 
          In this question, we have to take care of the prototype in JavaScript.

          Code- 
                Array.prototype.extraProperty = "Aditya"
          Now, Every array has an additional property named extraProperty.

                const newArray = [1,2,3,4]
                for(let v in newArray){
                     console.log(v)
                }

        Output- 
               0 
               1 
               2 
               3 
               extraProperty


      Now, the problem is to ignore the additional properties.
      For this, we put a check in the if condition.
            
              for(let v in newArray){
                    if(newArray.hasOwnProperty(v){
                     console.log(v)
                } 
              }

      So, hasOwnProperty is only True for the original property that's why it only displays the original property.

      Output- 
              0 
              1 
              2 
              3
